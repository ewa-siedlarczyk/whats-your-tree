### Background

I like and admire trees. 

They are present in many aspects of our lives, including our culture.
One of such cultural elements focused on trees is Celtic Tree Astrology. 

There are at least two versions of it: one with 13 species and another with 22 species.
It is possible that the 22-species version is specific to Poland, but I do not know for sure.

Anyway, I like it more, since it includes actual trees and only occasionally shrubs, 
unlike the 13-species variant with vines and grasses (I might be too orthodox for this one).

I could not find a program for an automatic Celtic Tree Astrology search, so here it goes.
